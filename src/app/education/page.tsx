            I have a BSc in Medical Science, which has provided me with a strong
            foundation in scientific principles and problem-solving skills. Now, I am pursuing a course in Cloud
            Applied Generative AI Engineering with the aim of becoming a skilled web developer. My focus is on
            combining my scientific background with the latest technologies to create innovative web solutions
            that can transform user experiences and push the boundaries of what is possible in the digital world.
